# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
it was a bit stressful, I couldnt figure out some of the answers and it was a bit defeating, but my plan is to look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Its been decent, this weekend was the worst but Im getting mroe used to letting my brain rest and then moving on. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

How everything connects and the different codes taht really trie everything together.
